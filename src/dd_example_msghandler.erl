%% ReplyPid is the Pid on which to send the reply (if there is one).
%%
%% Prefix is the part that contains the nickname and host on most messages
%% Especially PRIVMSG etc.
%% 
%% Command is the type of message it is. CTCP messages get converted from PRIVMSG to
%% CTCP and CTCP_REPLY for easy matching
%% 
%% Args is the list of arguments that is supplied. For example the channel to which the message
%% has been sent.
%% 
%% Tail is the actual message. The things people type in IRC are here.
